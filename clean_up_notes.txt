Make CSV and make the edits on those. Columns that need cleaning are
date of birth, city, resident street address, and place of birth.
The top priorites are date of birth, city, and resident street address.

The CSV will use the booking number as the unique key. Should probably 
include the SOID because that uniquely identifes individuals and will be 
helpul for resolving date of birth, place of birth, and to a lesser extent
the resident street address and city. 

Nothing should be deleted. Instead an addtional column should be created
with the string "corrected_" concatenated to the original column name.


OpenRefine has a built in limit for the amount of data it will read in.
Max says you can increase the limit by modifying the .ini file

In the jail.db file the POB column is a cancatenation of address city and POB

Once the data is cleaned we can include if an address is a homeless shelter
